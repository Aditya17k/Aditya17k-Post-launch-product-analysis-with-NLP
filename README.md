I analysed consumer perception and their areas of interest and concern, while comparing 2 product models


I took data from subreddits related to the iPhone 14 and 15 pro and collect it for a period of 4 months from the time of release. Using this data, I understood what the customers are talking about, what are their sentiments toward the products were and understood the level of satisfaction between the two products.

My research was driven by a desire to understand the consumer reception of the iPhone 14 Pro and 15 Pro. Through meticulous data
collection and analysis of subreddit discussions, I uncovered the highs and lows of consumer experiences, measuring the emotional response to the new iPhone model, and ultimately present a narrative of the product's reception in the eyes of its users.


Leveraging the wealth of user-generated content on the subreddit <iPhone 15 Pro Review: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly!> and（iPhone 14 pro），my research delved into the authentic, community-driven discourse surrounding the iPhone 15 Pro. This subreddit serves as a dedicated platform for users to candidly share their experiences, offering praise, expressing grievances, and pointing out flaws with Apple's latest flagship model.


As the goal was to extract and analyse the most significant terms from the dataset, using a combination of Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) analysis and sentiment analysis, to understand public perception and the dominant topics of discussion regarding this product.

The analysis revealed a diverse range of terms with high TF-IDF scores, signifying topics that were both unique to the discussion of the iPhone 14 & 15 Pro and of particular interest to the community. The sentiment scores associated with these terms offered insights into the community's perceptions, ranging from positive to negative. For instance, terms with higher sentiment scores might indicate features or aspects of the iPhone 14 & 15 Pro that are well-received, while those with lower scores could point to areas of concern or dissatisfaction among users.
